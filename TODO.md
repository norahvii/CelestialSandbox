- START

#### Plans for Sunday

- Plans for further work with Apache Airflow:
	1. Work within AstroGirls folder
	2. Slowly test and add DAGs from tutorials to the folder
	3. See if we can eventually have a few inter-relating products
	4. Rope Cat into the whole project
	5. Figure out if we can create the weather application or something related to chat bots
- Also going to have to add hours on UInteract 
- Nothing else really matters for Sunday, maybe get some exercise or start the day at Tower Grove park

#### Plans for Tuesday

- Going to have to touch base with our other Airflow contact
	- Not much else can be said about this. It's basically me filling the void until then.
